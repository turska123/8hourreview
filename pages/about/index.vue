        Hi! I'm Mika Turkia, the creator of 8 Hour Game Reviews. I play games for exactly 8 hours and share honest, concise reviews to help you decide what to play next.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        I'm a developer passionate about open source code and user privacy. I believe that respectful, non-intrusive approaches to online interactions are key to building trust and fostering a positive community. My goal is to create and share free, open-source projects that benefit others, relying on the kindness and support of the community to sustain my work.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        If you enjoy my work and want to support me, you can buy me a beer or coffee! Your support helps me continue creating content and maintaining this site. Every little bit helps, and I truly appreciate it:
